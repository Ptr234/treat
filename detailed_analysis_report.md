## 6. Data Structure Optimization Opportunities

### A. Current Structure Issues
```javascript
// Current: Repeated contact objects
contact: {
  agency: 'Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development',
  email: 'info@memd.go.ug',
  phone: '+256 414 707 000',
  website: 'https://www.memd.go.ug'
}
```

### B. Recommended Optimized Structure
```javascript
// Optimized: Reference-based structure
agencyId: 'memd',
// ... with separate agencies reference table
agencies: {
  'memd': {
    name: 'Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development',
    email: 'info@memd.go.ug',
    phone: '+256 414 707 000',
    website: 'https://www.memd.go.ug',
    address: 'Physical address here'
  }
}
```
